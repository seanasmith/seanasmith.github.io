          <h3>Organization Site</h3>

          <p>Using the CSS framework Bootstrap, I built a mock site for the Seguin High School Matador color guard. This site employed user research techniques to inquire into what a variety of users and site maintainers found important for a wensite.</p>

          <p>Emphasis was placed on schedules, calendars and providing general knowledge about what color guard is, as well as providing a photo gallery to display images of the color guard at football games and competitions.</p>

          <p>The site is very photo heavy and broken  into two main sections, the standard home area and a members-only area that would ideally only be accessable with a username and password.</p>

          <h3>Calendar design</h3>

          <p>The member&apos;s calendar utilizes Bootstrap&apos;s 12-column grid layout. The large typographic month indicator on the left spans five columns, and the calendar is built in the remaining seven columns, one for each day of the week.</p>

          <p>Each day is in its own div, classed as &quot;cal-box,&quot; with the CSS styling constraining its width to one-seventh of the seven columuns in which the calendar is built. This allowed the calendar to be responsive, though some additional styling is needed to clean up the calendar for smaller phone screens.</p>
