      <p><span id="dropcap">M</span>eat, smoke and (sometimes) sauce are the only necessary ingredients for American barbecue. But variations by region have spawned longheld rivlaries of who&apos;s got the best 'cue, and there often isn&apos;t a clear answer. This guide can&apos;t answer that question.</p>

      <img src="images/bbq.jpg" />

      <p>Rather, it will provide a breakdown of American regional barbecue from <a href="" target="_blank">the form closest to the cuisine&apos;s origins in the Carribean</a> to obscure regional specialties.</p>



      <p>Perhaps it&apos;s One of Texas&apos; four varieties, or one of the smaller regions in the Carolinas. Maybe the plurality of styles is what makes American barbecue special, and each variation is as valid as the next. That&apos;s for you to decide.</p>

      <p id="last-pretext">A staple cuisine of the South, barbecue has variations out west, too. Very west. All the way to Hawaii, in fact. Though these styles may not draw on southern roots and Carribean ancestry, their similarities in process and product mandate their inclusion on the map. Poke around the regions below, explore their styles, and find your favorite or learn something new. But try not to get too hungry.</p>

          data-paragraph-2="Often referred to as &quot;Cowboy&quot; or &quot;Hill Country&quot; barbecue, West Texas diverges from the Lone Star State's other regional variations by using direct heat and a wood with a stronger flavor: mesquite.</p>

          <p>This variation is widely considered to &quot;<a href='https://www.thrillist.com/eat/dallas/the-definitive-texas-barbecue-style-guide' target='_blank'>harken back to barbecue&apos;s Southern roots,</a>&quot; distiguishing its flavor from other Texas varieties. Direct-heat cooking allows the meat to capture the smoke from fat dripping on the wood below rather than pure, clean smoke alone.</p>

          <p>While considered one of the four regions of Texas barbecue, this style is commonly found in other states as well. Some consider it to have more in common with a whole-hog barbecue often seen in North Carolina than the offset pit smoking seen in Central and East Texas.">

        data-paragraph-2="Though it&apos;s becoming increasingly rare in Texas and thoughout the country as a genre, common terms from South Texas barbecue are starting to becoming houshold names. You may recognize barbacoa from the menu at Chipotle, but the real stuff is very, <i>very</i> different.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, whole heads &mdash; yes, as in the place with the face and the brain &mdash; of beef or goat is cooked for several hours in subterranian pits filled with smoldering mesquite wood embers and lined with banana or agave leaves. Otherwise, only tongue and cheek are used.</p>

        <p>The meat is unearthed, shredded and usually served with tortillas. More modern, but definitely nontraditional, ways of cooking &quot;barbacoa&quot; involve steamers, ovens or slowcookers which remain above ground. That&apos;s no fun.">

        data-paragraph-2="What&apos;s becoming ubiquitous with the general term <em>Texas barbecue</em>, Central Texas style revolves around beef; it&apos;s been like that since the beginning.</p>

        <p>German and Czech meat markets concentrated on portions of the Chisholm Trail near Bastrop, Luling, Lockhart, Taylor and Elgin, and these butchers turned to smoking and sausage making to make use of unsold cuts of beef. To this day, Central Texas-style establishments carve meat in front of customers and serve it on red butcher paper as an homage to these barbecue pioneers.</p>

        <p>For most of the late 1900s, barbecue conisseurs had to <a href='https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/our-guide-to-central-texas-barbecue/' target='_blank'>venture to the greater Austin area</a> for high-quality Central Texas barbecue, but its popularity has blossomed as of late, and most major cities in the state have notable joints of this variety.">

        data-paragraph-2="East Texas stretches from the southern corners of Arkansas and Oklahoma, down the entire length of western Louisiana to the gulf coast. Naturally, there&apos;s a lot of variation in this style. Two things that are standard: pork is valid, and sauce is necessary.</p>

        <p>This style has roots in Deep South barbecue brought to Texas through slave migration. Pretty much everything gets coated in tomato-based sauce &mdash; including pork, which is just as prominent as beef.</p>

        <p>Boudin (or boudain, depending on how close to Louisiana you are) is also prevalent here. The cajun-style sausage is most popular in deep East Texas, while more Central Texas-style garlic sausage shows up closer to the coast and in Houston.">

        data-paragraph="<span>Cuts &amp; Variations:</span> Pork prepared &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;dry&quot;</p><p><span>Wood &amp; Cook:</span>Hickory chunks added to charcoal"

        data-paragraph-2="Wet or dry? Picnic shoulder or Boston butt? Mustard or mayo slaw? Memphians debate a lot internally about what true Memphis style barbecue is. One thing is certain: pork reigns supreme.</p>

        <p>Typically in the form of ribs or pulled pork, the Memphis meat staple is cooked in large pits over charcoal with chunks of hickory added to flavor the smoke. Ribs can be seasoned with dry rub only, mopped in either tomato- or vinegar-based sauce, or served &quot;muddy&quot; (that&apos;s a bit of wet and a bit of dry). Coleslaw can be found atop a pulled pork sandwich rather than on the side.</p>

        <p>If you needed more proof that pork is Memphis' meat, <a href='http://www.memphisinmay.org/events/world-championship-barbecue-cooking-contest/' target='_blank'>the world's largest pork barbecue contest</a> is held there yearly. No brisket in sight.">

        data-paragraph-2="Kansas Citians will smoke anything and everything with, well, anything and everything. There&apos;s no one dominant meat or wood, but brisket burnt ends are a KC demand. The lack of one defining meat comes from the city&apos;s status as a meatpacking hub.</p>

        <p>The woods used most commonly are hickory, oak, pecan and apple, as timber of these kinds were known to populate the area in the early 1900s, when barbecue begain rising in local popularity.</p>

        <p>Burnt ends, the fatty, super-caramelized end cut of a beef brisket, are the local specialty, and even Central Texas spots have been known to sell their burnt ends. The sauce is sticky, rich and molasses heavy with a little spice and is served along side the meat with various sides.">

        data-paragraph-2="St. Louis style often refers to the cut of the pork ribs rather than a defining style of cook, wood and sauce. Rib tips and cartilage are removed to create a uniform, rectangular-shaped rib rack which adds to the presentation. Naturally, this ribs are often used in competition.</p>

        <p>One can argue, however, that the preferred method of cooking in St. Louis style &mdash; grilling directly over the heat source &mdash; is not technically barbecue, which usually involves slow cooking or smoking over wood.</p>

        <p>Sweet, sticky, acidic tomato-based sauce is applied liberally after the ribs are grilled. How liberally? Well, <a href='https://www.stlmag.com/dining/Ask-George-What-is-St-Louis-Style-Barbecue/' target='_blank'>St. Louis consumes more barbecue sauce than any other city in America</a>. For a style that&apos;s one city rather a whole region of a state, that has to be a lot.">

        data-paragraph-2="Alabama style is often seen as an amalgamation of southern regional style, drawing on Memphis, the Carolinas and Kentucky for its characteristics. Like most of the Old South, pork is king and varies in the form of ribs, pulled pork and even whole hams.<p>

        <p>Internal variation is found among Alabama style, too. A vinegar-based sauce is found in regions near the Tennessee River and the Carolinas, while a mayonnaise-based white barbecue sauce is popular near the coast. Yes, white barbecue sauce is a thing and was once reserved for barbecued chicken, but it can now be found on pork as well.</p>

        <p>Sandwiches are piled high with pulled pork and coleslaw, much like Memphis style, but dill pickle sare also often found atop a sandwich as Alabama&apos;s defining condiment.">

        <p>Some argue that eastern style is <a href='https://www.ourstate.com/nc-barbecue-styles/' target='_blank'>the truest form of barbecue to the carribean origins</a> of the cuisine, and regions west and south started experimenting with different sauces and cuts of meat. Regardles, pork is prevalent in both North Carolinian styles.</p>

        <p>Western North Carolina or Lexington style uses a red sauce made from ketchup, vinegar and spices, and even the coleslaw gets some barbecue sauce in its dressing. Easterners use vinegar-based sauces and ditch the ketchup in the slaw for mayo or whipped salad dressings.">

        <p>Eastern/Coastal South Carolina, known as the &quot;Pee Dee&quot; region, mirrors eastern North Carolina&apos;s vinegar-and-pepper sauce, while western South Carolina features a mustard-based sauce commonly referred to as &quot;Carolina Gold.&quot;</p>

        <p>Pee Dee barbeuce uses whole hog, while western South Carolina uses pork shoulder, Boston butts and hams. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/a-south-carolina-barbecue-primer/2016/08/01/13c3b80c-527f-11e6-b7de-dfe509430c39_story.html?utm_term=.4ec1216a4acd' target='_blank'>Some divide South Carolina&apos;s regions into four</a>, with more variations of sauce and preferred cut.

        <p>Santa Maria-style barbecue, as a social event rather than purely a method of cooking, <a href='https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-things-to-know-about-santa-maria-style-barbecue_us_5942a18ae4b06bb7d271670f' target='_blank'>evolved from large parties thrown by ranchers for vaqueros or cowboys after large cattle roundups</a>. Concentrated in coastal Central California, Santa Maria-style invokes adjustable iron grills that move over coals to control temperature.</p>

        <p>No sauce involved with Santa Maria-style, just a dry rub of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Sides vary from beans and salsas to salads and French bread, and while the style is more akin to grilling than the smoking of Texas and the Carolinas, it&apos;s still a deeply held cultural example of barbecue.">

        <p>Whole hog roasts over open pits or wrapped in leaves and cooked underground are mainstays at large social events, though more mainstream varieties feature standard grilled meats coated in sticky sauces that draw from contemporary pan-Asian cuisine.</p>

        <p>Similar to California, the traditional barbecue aspect is most prominent in the socialization that occurs around the food rather than the food itself. And while it seems vastly different than the slow smoked pit barbecue of Central Texas or the Southern roots-style of Alabama, Hawaiian barbecue is becoming increasingly popular.">
