        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Writing HTML and CSS</li>
          <li>Moving and accessing files on servers</li>
          <li>Knowing HTML and CSS Semantics</li>
          <li>Practice designing content for the Web</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>You will create a simple, personal portfolio website for your first project. We will begin with writing the basic content needed for the site to appear on the web using HTML. After creating this structured content, we will stylize the site using CSS.</p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Create a site with at least four pages. A landing page, a couple pages dedicated to displaying your work and a page with more info about you and contact info is pretty standard. You can deviate from that model, however, if you can justify the way you've constructed your site. Be creative and thoughtful in your process.</li>
          <li>Create the site using the HTML elements we learned in class.
            <ul>
              <li>Create a menu using &lt;ul&gt;</li>
              <li>Include at least one image</li>
              <li>Add at least three links to external sites</li>
              <li>Add your email using mailto:</li>
              <li>A fair amount of content filling the site, including multiple projects displayed on the portfolio page</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>Create a folder on your server called projects, and create a folder within that folder called project_1. Upload your four HTML files and any image files you&apos;re using to this folder. Your homepage should be called index.html, and your other pages may have file names of your choice.</li>
          <li>Post a link to your site in #general on Slack by Feb. 1
            <ul>
              <li>During class on Feb. 1, we will view each other&apos;s sites and discuss the content structures we&apos;ve created. At this point, your website should look relatively plain, in black and white with no visual styling.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>Add CSS to your website using an external stylesheet. This stylesheet should be titled main.css and added to your project_1 folder once completed. The required CSS is listed below.
            <ul>
              <li>Constrain the website body to the center of the page at 60 percent width</li>
              <li>Edit fonts for headings and paragraphs</li>
              <li>Resize and add border to image</li>
              <li>Edit link, table and menu styling</li>
              <li>Post a link to your site in #general on Slack by class time Feb. 15.</li>
            <ul></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Grading:</h3>

        <p>Project 1 is worth 150 points. Grammar, spelling and punctuation matter in all written content. These are most likely your first websites, so they don&apos;t need to be visually stunning, but time, effort and thought spent on the project will be evident. A rough outline for grading is presented below. See the rubric for a more detailed breakdown.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A+: Beyond minimum HTML components and CSS styling. Markup is well-formatted and correctly expresses the content&apos;s structure.</li>
          <li>A: All site requirements met</li>
          <li>B: Some requirements not met. Missing components, a few HTML errors that affect content structure, issues displaying items written in code</li>
          <li>C: Numerous HTML errors, missing pages, several missing components</li>
          <li>F: Systemic errors, turned in late, critical errors.</li>
        </ul>
