        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Use skills learned throughout the semester to redesign project 1</li>
          <li>Learn how to choose which method of site building is appropriate for your needs</li>
          <li>Build an effective portfolio to display your work</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>The final project requires you to redesign your personal site. You may use HTML and CSS, Bootstrap or Wordpress to rebuild your site. Focus on the design principles and advanced techniques (advanced CSS, responsive design, etc.) we covered after project 1 was completed. This project should be the basis of the portfolio site you will use throughout the rest of your academic and professional career.</p>

        <p><em>Keep in mind:</em> I&apos;ll take into account what platform you use to build your site. For example: Wordpress lets you add more functionality and build sites faster, so I expect a lot of focus on content and the design principles when using Wordpress. If you code with Bootstrap or plain HTML and CSS, I'll look more at the code you've written and expect less content and fewer advanced design principles used. If you&apos;re a DMI major and/or thinking of taking the code camp or another advanced coding class, I highly recommend using HTML and CSS or Bootstrap rather than Wordpress. This will help keep those skills sharp as you move on to other coding topics.</p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Decide which method of site building you will use.</li>
          <li>Sketch two drafts of the site you will design. Draw on what you learned from the this course regarding design principles.</li>
          <li>Meet with me during office hours to discuss the site and ensure you're on the right track.</li>
          <li>Build at <strong>least two pages of your site if using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap</strong>: one must be the portfolio page that displays your projects. If using Wordpress, all four pages from project 1 must be rebuilt.</li>
          <li>Present the project during our class' scheduled finals time.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Grading:</h3>

        <p>Project 4 is worth 200 points. See the rubric for detailed breakdown of grading criteria.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A+: Clean code, follows design principles well, responsive and functioning</li>
          <li>A: Few errors in code or design, responsive, accurately represents the student and his or her work</li>
          <li>B: Some errors in code, design, responsiveness or functionality</li>
          <li>C: Many errors in code and design, minimal effort in building an effective portfolio</li>
          <li>F: Systemic errors, turned in late, critical errors.</li>
          <li><em>HTML/CSS/Bootstrap extra credit:</em> Build out the full site with at least four pages total</li>
          <li><em>Wordpress extra credit:</em> Forthcoming...I'm still thinking of something.</li>
        </ul>
